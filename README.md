# Difference-Objects-Classes


Classes are like the definition of a word, while objects are the actual word being defined. So an object is defined by its class.

Classes are like the definition of a word, while objects are the actual word being defined. So an object is defined by its class. 
This analogy helps us understand the foundational relationship between these two core concepts in object-oriented programming.

A class is like a set of codes or instructions. In other words, a class serves as a foundation or blueprint for how an object appears and behaves. 
Just as a dictionary provides the definition and context for a word, a class outlines the properties and behaviors that objects of that class will have. 
For example, a class named Book might specify attributes such as color, genre, and model, and behaviors such as the writing style. This class defines what any book object will be capable of and what data it will hold.

An object, on the other hand, is used to store data in instance variables. It’s like a storage unit or executor that holds and executes the data and instructions defined by its class. 
Continuing with the Book example, an object of this class could be myBook, which might have specific values for color, genre, and model—for instance, myBook could be “the hatchet”(a green, 
blue-ish book, that’s square). Each object maintains its own state and can perform actions defined by the class's methods. 
This means that myBook can be used as a method to obtain entertainment(or knowledge), 
based on how these methods are implemented in the Book class.

In essence, classes are the templates that specify what data and behavior objects will have, 
much like genetic codes determine a living organism's traits. Objects are instances created from these templates, 
embodying the data and behaviors described by their class. 
Just as genetic codes are a foundation for how an animal or living organism appears and behaves, 
classes provide the structure for how objects should function.

Thus, the relationship between classes and objects is foundational to object-oriented programming, 
enabling the creation of modular, reusable, and 
manageable code by clearly defining the properties and actions of different types of objects.
