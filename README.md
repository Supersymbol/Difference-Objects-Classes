# Difference-Objects-Classes


Classes are like the definition of a word, while objects are the actual word being defined. So an object is defined by its class.

A class is like a set of codes/instructions in other words a foundation of how an object appears and behaves, 
as genetic codes are a set of codes/instructions(foundation) of how an animal(or living organism) 
appears and behaves(generally speaking anyway).

An Object is used to store data in instance variables. Itâ€™s a storage/executor that holds and executes the data the set class determines.
